## Introduction
AdopaPet is a two-sided platform aimed to connect those looking for a new pet with shelter animals in search of a home. 

## Functionality
On one hand, it allows website users to 
  * quickly search through animal profiles using swipe gesture UX design,
  * view details of and match with animals of their choice, and 
  * book appointments with the respective rescue centers to meet the animals in person. 

On the other, these animal rescue organizations can easily
  * add and manage animal profiles,
  * view adoption application forms from interested users, and
  * manage appointment bookings of animal viewings.
